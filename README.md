## Not Found On My Website
I was always uneasy about open source because there were so many talented people. By contributing, they actually brush off on you. I started contributing to projects I feel very comfortable with because I deeply understand Chemistry. Not shown on my website are my contributions to cheminformatic projects like...

- RDKit
- Datamol
- Molfeat

I enjoy working on these projects and would be able to speak on them whenever.

## Blog

I love sharing my thoughts on software development and frequently write about my experiences on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/dashboard). You can find links to all of my articles on this website's [blog](https://dev.to/dashboard/blog) page.

## Projects

I'm passionate about open-source software and have several projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/dessygil) page. Feel free to check them out and contribute if you'd like!

## Resume

If you want to learn more about my professional experience, you can find my resume [here](https://github.com/dessygil/Resume). It includes my work history, skills, and education. 

P.S. My resume is automatically built into a PDF directly from Overleaf using GitHub actions. If this is something that interests you check it out on GitHub as well as my [Blog](https://dev.to/dessygil/how-to-automatically-update-resume-on-your-personal-site-from-overleaf-1fld)
